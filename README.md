Java Jumble Word Finder
This project was intended for the purpose of the event organized by the Computer Science Club at Caldwell University. In this project we are provided with the jumbled word, we need to then find the correct word by reading the file Javaprogram.txt. I have implemented this project to find the jumbeled word given during our event only. It can be modified as required by the user to find any jumble word within the JavaProgram.txt.
